Need to check whether addClass("blabla") matches any already existing in current project. Look for "styling" in js file to know names of classes used by widget.
Target is full check: should have ability to skip this check if infinite items can be dropped. Modify lines like following:
	if (this.$items.length == this.maxItems) {
		// target is full
		this.full = true;
copy draggable is supported. move draggable isn't yet supported.
